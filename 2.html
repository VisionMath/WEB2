        <h2>CSS란 무엇인가?</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 40px;">
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the
            presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is
            a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
            JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
            content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve
            content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification
            of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting
            by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity
            and repetition in the structural content
