        <p style="margin-top: 40px;">
            JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming
            language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside
            HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web
            page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web
            browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute
